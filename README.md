**Ping Tester Tool** is a simple and efficient utility designed to check IP addresses in a user-friendly interface with multiple tabs. Unlike traditional command-line tools, where users need to press `Ctrl+C` to stop and start a new ping in a new terminal, this tool allows you to ping multiple hosts simultaneously, providing an organized and convenient way to monitor connectivity.
